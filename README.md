# Sikh-App

## A spiritual app consisting of holy reading and videos

## Vision Statement

The aim is to create an app that might be used by thousand of people to start their day with a spiritual tour of their holy readings. The app consists of many sikh readings and videos.

## Tools and technologies

I have used the Google's flutter platform to create an IOS and Androind application in one go, the main programming language in dart which is fundamentally very easy to learn. I have also used the Android studios project structure as the initial stage for my application.

## a sneak-peak at the application
